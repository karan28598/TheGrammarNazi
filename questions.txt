0. What is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?

1.  According to its man page, what does getrusage do?
    It returns resource usage measures for a process(es).
    
2.  Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type struct rusage?
    There are 16 members in a structure.
    
3.  Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate, even though we’re not changing their contents?
    They are very large structs. You would have to copy the data. You could instead access it through reference.
    
4.  Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how main goes about reading words from a file. In other words, convince us that you indeed understand how that function’s for loop works.
    fgetc reads in a character into c one at a time. For loop continues until fgetc gets an EOF. Then puts it into a character array for word. Index increases so next c put into next stop. Resets index with new word.
    
5.  Why do you think we used fgetc to read each word’s characters one at a time rather than use fscanf with a format string like "%s" to read whole words at a time? Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on fscanf alone?
    There are several problems with fscanf - first, you must allocate a memory for a string before reading it from file, and there are no limits of a length of a word in a text file. Also you can't write program logic for skipping alphanumeric words, like this implementation of speller has. Overall, this approach gives us much less flexibility.
   
6.  Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as const (which means "constant")?
    The parameters for check and load are constants because those parameters are never intented to be modified in the functions.
